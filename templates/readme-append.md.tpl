## Multi-Agent Workflow

This project uses an agent-driven workflow. See:
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — entry point for Claude Code sessions
- `AGENTS.md` — entry point for Codex CLI sessions
- `spec/engineering-standards.md` — non-negotiable engineering rules
- `agents/<role>/` — agent definitions and memory
- `workflows/` — named workflows (analyze-design-dev-review, bug-triage, spike-research, release)
- `sprints/` — backlog and active sprint files

Run a sprint:
```
/sprint 001 developer analyze-design-dev-review US-001
```
